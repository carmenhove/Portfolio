### Using Bayesian spline regression in R to estimate effects of lactation on maternal immune function

While the impact of breastfeeding behavior on infant health has been well-studied, the effects of lactational practices on maternal health are comparatively understudied. This study (which I designed and implemented with my colleagues at UCSB and UW during the COVID-19 pandemic) investigated the effects of breastfeeding on diurnal change in secretion rate of “pro-inflammatory” salivary cytokines and C-reactive protein. I used Bayesian spline regressions to show that breastfeeding is associated with non-linear effects on diurnal IL-8 and CRP, with women who report zero versus ubiquitous ATN breastfeeding exhibiting opposing diurnal patterns in CRP secretion rate.
